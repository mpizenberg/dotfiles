# Dotfiles

This repo contains my configuration files.
Each directory corresponds to a program.
The content of each directory directly maps
the hierarchy of files from the home directory.

To install config files, I use GNU stow.
To install vim config files for example:

```shell
stow vim --no-folding
```
